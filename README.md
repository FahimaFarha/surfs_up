## Project Overview
W.Avy has asked us to analyze the weather in Oahu, Hawaii using SQLite Weather Data to determine whether or not it would an ideal location to open up an ice cream shop and surf gear shop.

## Challenge Summary
   We used weather data to analyze the temperature and rain fall patterns for the months of June and December in between the years 2010 - 2017 in Oahu, Hawaii. Using the describe function we were able to determine that for the most part, the temperature in Oahu does not drastically differ bewteen June and December. The average temperature in June was 74.9 degrees while the average temperature in December was 71.0 degrees. In addition, the average rainfall between the two months is also around the same.
   
   Based on the two factors mentioned above, it would seem like Oahu would be a great spot to open up an ice cream and surf gear shop. However, I would suggest further analysis before giving the green light to build such an establishment. One thing to look at would be the amount of rain fall in all the months of the year and see if there are any months with particularly bad weather. In addtion, it would be benefical to see what the statistics of tourist travel is like in Oahu. There might be a large spike in some months and a detrimental drop in others. Also, it would be good to research the competition and see how many other surf shops and ice cream places there are. If a certain part of Oahu is already flooded with these shops, it would not be in our favor to open op there.
